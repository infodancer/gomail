Gomail is an implementation of internet mail protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) in go.
It follows the qmail-daemonserver conventions of using a wrapper to do network activity.
It is intended to be a network host mail system only (does not deliver to local users).
The goal is to produce an efficient, secure, small mail system that is suitable for individuals 
to set up and run easily in a modern mail environment without a lot of administrative overhead.
Eventually suitable for running on a home server or a cloud environment.
