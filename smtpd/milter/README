Milters are mail filters that run outside of a smtp daemon but communicate
with it following a defined network protocol.  Similar, but not identical,
to spamassassin used with spamc.  Popular with sendmail and postfix for 
implementing various mail filtering capabilities.

No reason not to support it here, if the effort is reasonable.  But basic
functionality will need to be implemented first.
